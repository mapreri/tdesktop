The upstream tarball of Telegram Desktop includes a some patches for Qt and
other utilities that are not dfsg-compliant, I chose to repack the tarball
removing also the bundled libraries to prevent copyright issues and be sure
Telegram Desktop uses the system libraries.

See debian/copyright for an list of removed files.
